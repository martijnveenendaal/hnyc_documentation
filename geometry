## Geometry Editing Guide
---

### Documentation Guidelines

Please keep your own notes. Also log issues and questions you’re having (either with a particular segment or with the ArcGIS software) on the [Street Geometry Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/sqVDLXwu/street-geometries) as an issue card. Include a screenshot and a brief description of the issue (e.g. “Basemap missing in Canarsie”). Use the Trello board labels (e.g. FYI, Can Wait, Critical) and tag other team members on the card.

### Guiding Principles for Street Geometry

* Do not blindly trust georeferenced maps. Always consult at least 2 sources (e.g. contemporary map, different atlas editions, city directories) before making edits.
* Make sure that all segments snap onto each other. This will be critical for geocoding and calculating travel time.
* Mark a “1” in the “geometry check [census year]” field for every segment without issues
* Don’t be trigger happy with the delete button. Deleted segments are gone. Forever.
* When in doubt, flag an issue on the Geometry Trello Board. It is important that we resolve difficult issues together to ensure common practices.

### Common Issues
---
Some common issues for geometry editing are:

* Two or more segments need to merged
* A segment needs to be split into two or more segments
* Missing segments need to be drawn into existing streets
* Intersections are imperfect and break up continuing streets
* Two atlas editions from years surrounding the census year show different developments
* Unopened or planned streets need to be drawn in
* Due to urban developments streets on the waterfront are absent
* Old country roads intersect with the (existing or proposed) city grid
* Old buildings appear in the middle of existing or planned roads
* Ambiguous alleys or unnamed streets
* Segments that already have attributes filled in need to be planarized
* Basemaps are poorly georeferenced
* Georeferenced maps overlap at edges, covering important information

### Strategies for Common Issues
---
#### Screening, Merging, and Splitting

All street segments need to be checked for geometry errors. Using the “select tool”, draw a line over a number of segments to see if their geometry corresponds with the situation for the given year (1910, 1880, 1850). If the city block consists of two or more segments, merge them. If a street segment extends beyond intersections with other streets, split the segment at the junction. When a segment is checked, mark a “1” in the attribute field “Geometry Check”.

#### Missing Segments

Where there are missing segments along clear streets, make sure to add these back in. This can happen where portions of streets no longer exist due to large scale developments, e.g. parks, highways, housing projects. Draw in a new street segment in the direction of ascending address numbers. Be sure to snap the new street segment to the junctions on either side. 

Alternatively, if the missing segment is at the end of the road, you can extend the existing street as a benchmark in order to ensure the right placement of the new segment. Then, draw in the new segment based on the benchmark street. Afterwards, move the existing street back to its original place.

#### Imperfect Intersections

Along intersections there are often segments that connect those holding address ranges but do not represent any ranges or buildings themselves. They can be a result of an imperfect junction or the intersection of boulevard streets with multiple segments, and are important in maintaining the consistency of each street. Even if they do not contain any ranges themselves, make sure to add them where streets clearly continue across intersections.

#### Discrepancies Between Atlas Editions

In some cases, maps of different years contain different or contradictory information. When there is a discrepancy between different atlas plates, try to infer whether roads were in existence and in use at the census year from other sources, e.g. city directories, current situation, and other maps. 

In one case, a 1906 map included a series of planned roads, while 1916 showed an extension of the adjacent cemetery instead. Today, the cemetery exists and it looks like the planned roads from 1906 were never built. However, we decided to add in these roads anyway, since we cannot know for sure their status in 1910 or if anyone lived in this area at any point before the cemetery extension. As a rule, it is always best to preserve as much information as possible. In cases like this, streets that exist in one map but not another should usually be added nonetheless. It can also be helpful to double check with the directories of surrounding dates to see if any numbers were ever assigned to the area.

#### Drawing In Unopened Streets

In the example above, new street segments need to be drawn in. When you need to create a larger collection of streets rather than just one segment, try to use as many anchor points from the existing street network. 

If roads are broken up by a river, canal, park etc, or in this case a cemetery, you can follow the following strategy:

#### Waterfront

Often waterfront streets and docks are missing segments where streets are visible in the corresponding atlas maps. To best reflect these industrial areas and their buildings, add segments for streets leading to the waterfront wherever there are clear indications of opened streets and/or potential addresses. Reference all basemaps in deciding where to add segments and their end points.

#### Old Roads

There are a number of old country roads that intersect with the street grid, especially in outer neighborhoods of Brooklyn. When encountering such roads, it is important to establish whether they are still in use. Ask yourself a set of questions in each ambiguous case. Are there buildings or plots that align with the old street? Does the old street intersect with buildings that follow the new grid system? Are the intersections and junctions with other streets colored, implying continued use? If it seems likely that the road was still operational, **planarize** with other existing roads.

In the example below, an old road intersects with the new grid at various points. Since there are buildings and plots aligned with the old road, we can conclude that it’s still in use. The road should be drawn in and then planarized with existing intersecting streets.

#### Buildings and Roads Overlapping

There are a lot of cases where old buildings along old roads intersect with planned but unopened grid streets. These will most likely have no official addresses and will shortly be demolished. In these cases it is best to mark the streets unopened with no addresses if none are found on either the map or the directory. Make sure to reference each map year

#### Alleys

There are a number of alleys across the city, particularly in industrial waterfront areas such as Dumbo in Brooklyn. They are usually named but do not contain any addresses. In these cases, add missing segments for alleyways, write in their names if they have them, mark additional or secondary names written in parentheses, and check for address ranges on the maps and in the directories (they often don't have any). Also check to see if they exist today, and if additional information can be recorded based on their current condition.

#### Planarizing Streets With Attributes

When you planarize streets that have attribute fields filled in, the attributes will duplicate into the new street segments. Look at the attributes of each new segment and change them immediately after planarizing if they are no longer correct.

#### Poor Georeferencing

Sometimes it may seem like the streets of an entire neighborhoods are misaligned and need significant geometry edits. However, it may just be that the atlas plate is poorly georeferenced. In a situation like that, first compare the different atlas plates. Also take into consideration the contemporary street network in order to determine whether is is the geometry or the atlas that is misaligned.

#### Map Seams

At streets located on the border of two atlas maps, or wherever two maps touch, there will often be some overlap, where one map will cover the edge of the other. Here information from the covered map can be lost, and it is important to record this information by either manually viewing the map from its source site, or cropping the covering map if there is no available external information. In many instances, it suffices to leave the map covered and pull up another copy temporarily to record the necessary address ranges. Long term edits should be made to the map layer to be able to see all information permanently. Record the issue on Trello.
